# Image Encryptor/Decryptor

A simple GUI-based application to encrypt and decrypt images using  image pixels and a user-provided key. This tool uses Python's `Pillow` and `NumPy` libraries for image manipulation and `Tkinter` for the graphical user interface.

---

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypts an image using a key (0-255) and saves the result as `encrypted_image.png`.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts the encrypted image using the same key and saves the result as `decrypted_image.png`.
- **Simple GUI**: User-friendly interface with options to browse files and input encryption keys.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the encryption key is a valid integer within the range of 0-255.
- Note : Ensure that the selected image file is accessible from the project directory or provide the correct path during encryption.
